		<p>CivilSurvey is an open source, lightweight survey engine built with Angular.js, driven by a JSON API. Copyright (C) Laura Hughes, 2015.</p>

		<h2>Installation</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Copy all of the files onto your webspace.</li>

			<li>Build your survey. Update the "/json/survey.json" file with your own survey metadata. The rest of the .json files are survey questions; you can remove them and build your own. See "The CivilSurvey API" below for details.</li>

			<li>Figure out some way to store the values. Currently, as this is just a frontend demo, I simply display the raw values at the end of the survey, but on my to-do list is adding some quick way of dumping them into a database.</li>
		</ol>

		<h2>The CivilSurvey API</h2>
		<p>CivilSurvey data consists of two types: the survey metadata, and the question metadata. Each survey has only one survey metadata file, and one question metadata file for each question.</p>

		<h3>Survey Metadata File</h3>

		<ul>
			<li><h4>title</h4> Text. Optional. The survey's title. Appears on the top of the page.</li>
			<li><h4>instructions</h4> Text/HTML. Optional. Text to appear on the top of the page.</li>
			<li><h4>footer</h4> Text/HTML. Optional. Text to appear on the bottom of the page.</li>
			<li><h4>pages</h4> Array of JSON objects. Each object in this array is a survey page. A survey page is simply a set of questions that are shown at once, with a submit button. Page object parameters:
				<ul>
					<li><h5>questions</h5> Array of text strings. Each string is the name of a question that should appear on this page.
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Question Metadata File</h3>
		Each question file should have the same name as the question it constains. In other words, if you have a question called "age", that question's metadata should be in a file called age.json. The string "age" would appear in the survey metadata file on the page where you want the question to appear. And the "name" attribute of the question should also be "age".

		<ul>
			<li><h4>text</h4> String or HTML. The text of the question that is shown to the user. For example, "What is your age?"</li>
			<li><h4>type</h4> String. The question type; what kind of input the user can provide. Possible values:
				<ul>
					<li><h5>text</h5></li>
					<li><h5>number</h5></li>
					<li><h5>email</h5></li>
					<li><h5>url</h5></li>
					<li><h5>textarea</h5></li>
					<li><h5>select</h5></li>
					<li><h5>noInput</h5> A "question" with no option for user input; just text/HTML. Useful for "thank you" elements, providing mid-survey instructions, showing creatives, and so forth.</li>
				</ul> 
			</li>
			<li><h4>required</h4> Boolean. Optional. Default = false. If true, prevents submission when the user has not filled in an answer.</li>
		</ul>
